#Homework

1.Create user-space program which allocates buffers x = 0..64 with sizes 2^x and 2^x + 1
using functions: malloc, calloc, alloca.
Measure time of each allocation/freeing

2.Create kernel module and test allocation/freeing time for functions:
kmalloc, kzmalloc, vmalloc, get_free_pages
check time of each allocation and freeing

Results in should be in text file table with columns:
Buffer size, Allocation time, min, average, max,ns, freeing time min, av, max.
