# Homework Bash 2:

Create the script 'find_dup_files.sh'

First script parameter is the folder for searching.
In case of its absence the current folder should be used instead of it.
Print file names and file size for files with same md5 checksum.

Script should support command-line options:
  -h, --help - print program description and these options.

Tips:
* use find utility for get list of files names
* use md5sum utility for checksum
