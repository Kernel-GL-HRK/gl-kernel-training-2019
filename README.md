# Homework:

Create a rock-paper-scissors console game
(rules https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors)

The game should be simple, the goal is to create a git project with proper commit order and structure. E.g.:

```
> Please choose: rock (r) - paper (p) - scissors (s)
> r
> You choose rock, I choose paper
> I win: paper beats rock
```
